## context.parameters
Information about how the command was invoked.

### options
Options are the command line flags.  Always exists however it may be empty.

```sh
$ staple say hello --loud -v  # { loud: true, v: true }
$ staple wave --times 5       # { times: 5 } 
```

### string
Everything else after the command as a string.

```sh
$ staple say hello there  # hello there
```

### array
Everything else after the command, but as an array.

```sh
staple reactotron plugin full  # ['plugin', 'full']
```

### first
The first element in `array`.

```sh
staple reactotron plugin full  # plugin
```

### second
The second element in `array`.

```sh
staple reactotron plugin full  # full
```

### third
The third element in `array`.

```sh
staple reactotron plugin full  # undefined
```

### full
This is a string of everything after the namespace.  I'm unclear why I have this here.

## context.config
This is an object.  Each plugin will have it's own root level key. 

It takes the plugin's defaults, and merges the user's changes overtop.

```js
// package.json from the plugin
{
  "staplegun": {
    "namespace": "myPlugin",
    "defaults": {
      "fun": false
    }
  }
}

// package.json from the user
{
  "staplegun": {
    "config": {
      "myPlugin": {
        "fun": true
      }
    }
  }
}

context.config.myPlugin.fun // true
```


## context.print
Features for allowing you to print to the console.

### stepComplete(action, message)
Indicates to that something relevant has been done.

The `action` parameter is string up to 20 characters long.  It should be the 
passed-tense verb like "generated" or "deleted".

The `message` parameter is a string up to 80 characters long.  It can be anything
relevant to what happened.  You're welcome to to use colors here like `highlight` to emphasize your message.

### debug()
Only used for debugging your plugins.  You can pass this function a string or an object. 

### colors
An object for working with printing colors on the command line.  It is from the `colors` NPM package, 
however we define a theme to make things a bit consistent.

Some available functions include:

function           | use when you want...
------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------
`colors.success()` | the user to smile
`colors.error()`   | to say something has failed
`colors.warn()`    | to point out that something might be off
`colors.info()`    | to say something informational
`colors.muted()`   | you need to say something secondary

Each take a `string` parameter and return a `string`. 

One gotcha here is that the length of the string is longer than you think
because of the embedded color codes that disappear when you print them. ðŸ”¥


## context.template
Features for generating files based on a template.

### generate(options)
