## Wait. What's TOML?

It's a human-first text file format that describes data structures.

* Is it like **XML**?
Not really. I mean, sure, it describes data structures, but XML is so formal.
And noisy for us to read.

* So then **JSON**?
Kind of, but less JavaScript themed. More flexible, with human things like comments.

* So like **JSON5**?
Closer, ya, but easier on the eye, JSON5 address much of the inflexibility of JSON.

* **INI** Files?
I remember those too! Easy to scan right? So those, but with opinions on
nested objects.

The big features for me is that:

1. It reads well without sacrificing too much structure.
2. Turns into JavaScript very nicely.
3. It accomodates a few different styles of text and nesting; use the one that reads better
   for the right circumstance.
