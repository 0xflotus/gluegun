# gluegun

`gluegun` is a framework for automating the boring parts of writing code.

Although it uses JavaScript (node.js 7 with `--harmony` to be specific), the
output can be whatever you want.

It sits in that spot between DIY scripts & full-featured monsters like Yeoman.

### What does it do?

It comes with an API for:

✅ code generation<br />
✅ massaging the filesystem<br />
✅ interacting with the Information Superhighway<br />
✅ reading command line parameters<br />
✅ writing colored console output<br />
✅ executing scripts<br />


### Extending

Write some JavaScript and extend the system completely.  Share those with others
by embedding them into your project or posting them on NPM.

If you stick the core extensions, you won't even have to have any dependencies. Just
the ones that ship with this app.



### 100% White Label

Programs like this shouldn't be the star.  This is just glue.  What you're making
is the real MVP.

`gluegun` is completely brandable for making & generating your own CLIs.

Or, make your own CLI and just use parts of `gluegun` for what you need.
