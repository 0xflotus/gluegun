# The namespace groups commands together.  Users will
# type this on the command line prompt to address the
# other commands you make available in this plugin.
#
# By default the namespace is the name of the directory
# that contains the plugin.toml file.  You can override
# this here.
#
# The end-user can also override this at their project
# as well.
#
# Try to name it something very specific that might not
# clash with other plugin developers.
#
# Good examples: 'ignite', 'reactotron'
# Bad examples: 'test', 'dev', 'react'
#
namespace = 'legit'

# Commands will be auto-detected and named based on how
# they appear in the 'commands' directory.
#
# You can 
#
# Example of what the user will type:
#   > staple legit hello
# or
#   > staple legit.hello
[command.hello]
summary = "says hello"

# $ staple legit 
[scripts.bye]
summary = "says goodbye"
